# NLP Yi-Gi-Oh

In this project, we are going to build a basic NLP model to classify Yu-Gi-Oh cards into their respective archetypes and banlist state based on their descriptions. We will use word embeddings and logistic regression to accomplish this task.

## Dataset
- **Yu-Gi-Oh Dataset**: [GitHub - Yu-Gi-Oh dataset](https://github.com/fferegrino/yu-gi-oh)

## Objective
We have chosen to use this dataset to train two models:

- **Model 1**: A classifier aimed at identifying a card's archetype based on its effect.
- **Model 2**: A classifier predicting whether a card should be banned or not.

## Install

At the root of the project, run: git clone https://github.com/fferegrino/yu-gi-oh/
